      <h2 class="mt-5"">Power laws</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The purpose of the Algebra module is to teach you new methods to manipulate and solve problems involving letters. Later, we use these methods to explore the relationship between an input and output variable on a graph, as a function.
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        Let us first consider what a "power", exponent or index (whatever term you may prefer) actually means: 
        $$
        a^n = a_1 \times a_2 ... \times a_n   
        $$
        As we see above "a to the power n" means "a times a, n times." There are various rules that allow us to simplify these terms if the base, a, is the same:
        <ol>
          <li>\(a^n \times a^m = a^{n + m}\)</li>
          <li>\(a^n \div a^m = a^{n - m}\)</li>
          <li>\( (a^n)^m = a^{n \times m}\)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Given we have defined the power rules for positive integer powers, how may we extend these to other number sets? What would \( a^0 \) be? Well intuitively you may think that it must be 0 as it would mean "a times a, 0 times". However, in mathematics, it is very important for rules to be consistent so we must define \( a^0 \) as 1 so that:

        $$
        \dfrac{a^1}{a^1} = a^{1 - 1} = a^0 = 1
        $$

        Now, how would we extend our understanding of power rules to negative numbers? Let us examine an example; if \( a \neq 0 \) and \( m < n\):
        $$
        \dfrac{a^{n-m}}{a^n} = a^{(n-m)-n} = \dfrac{a_1 \times a_2 \times ... a_{n-m} }{a_1 \times a_2 \times ... a_m } = \dfrac{1}{a^m}
        $$
        We can cancel each term on the top and bottom by a the maximum number of times possible and since there are fewer a terms on the top we would be left with 1 and the remaining \( a^m \) on the bottom. Therefore for negative powers we have the rule:

        $$
        a^{-m} = \dfrac{1}{a^m}
        $$

        Now we are ready to extend these rules to include all rational numbers (ie fractions). But first we must remind ourselves of what roots mean. A square root of a number, a, is the number which when multiplied by itself once gives the number a exactly; the nth root of a number, a, would be a number which when multiplied by itself n times gives the number a exactly. Some square roots are integers but a lot are irrational and are left in their root or surd form \( \sqrt{a} \). Using power rule 1. : <div id="2"></div>
        $$
        a^n \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} ... \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = a^{\tfrac{n}{n}} = a
        $$
        If we substitute \(a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = b\) we arrive at \( b^n = a \) so then we must define \(a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a} \). Finally, we end this section by generalising this for cases where the numerator is not 1 but instead \(m\):
        $$
        a^{\tfrac{m}{n}} = (a^{\tfrac{1}{n}})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m}
        $$

      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Surd rules and rationalising the denominator</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        With the power laws we introduced roots, Surds are simply irrational roots. Here are some rules for simplifying surds (and roots):
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>\((\sqrt[n]{a})^n = a\)</li>
          <li>\(\sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{a} \sqrt{b}\)</li>
          <li>\( \sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} \)</li>
          <li>\(c \sqrt{a} + d \sqrt{a} = (c + d)\sqrt{a} \)</li>
        </ol>
      <p class="lead">
        Sometimes when dealing with a problem, we want to frame it in a certain way or rewrite it into a certain form; this is not necessarily simplifying the problem; as is the case for rationalising the denominator. This means making the denominator contain only rational numbers and moving irrational numbers (surds) to the numerator. We can easily do this for a simple fraction such as \( \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \) by multiply top and bottom by \(\sqrt{a} \). However what about rationalizing \(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a} - b}\)? In order to do this recall algebraic identities involved in expanding double brackets:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li> \( (A+B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2 \) </li>
          <li> \( (A-B)^2 = A^2 - 2AB + B^2 \) </li>
          <li> \( (A+B)(A-B) = A^2 - B^2 \) </li>
        </ul>
      <p class="lead" id="3">
        The last identity is the difference of two squares and allows us to rationalize the denominator for more problems such as with the above example:
        $$
        \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a} - b} = \dfrac{1(\sqrt{a} + b)}{(\sqrt{a} - b)(\sqrt{a} + b)} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a} + b}{a - b^2}
        $$
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Quadratic functions</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        From GCSE we should know that a quadratic is a polynomial with the general form:
        $$
        ax^2 + bx + c = 0
        $$
        We should also be aware of functions which take a set of inputs (domain) and map them to a set of corresponding outputs (range). \( f(x) = x^2 + 2\) is an example of a quadratic function where \( f(x) \) means 'f of x' and represents the outputted value. Another way of thinking of this is \(f(x)\) is the dependent variable which depends on the value of \(x\). Often, \( f(x) = y\). As a rule of thumb, the dependent variable is plotted on the y-axis (vertical line), and the x-axis is the independent variable (horizontal).
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        What do quadratic graphs look like? Well they all have a general curved shape known as a parabola. The best way to learn about graphs, is to play around with them so we recommend you visit <a href="https://desmos.com" target="_blank">desmos</a> and investigate them yourself before continuing. Here is the graph of \( y = 2x^2 + 4x + 1 \): <br/>

      </p>
      <div class="text-center"><img src="img/algebra-quadraticgraph.png" class="rounded"></div>
      <p class="lead">
        From careful observation we see that the parabola crosses the x-axis twice and the y-axis once. Also the curve seems to be symmetric about its' minimum point. If we were able to find these points then we could sketch any quadratic graph:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>points on the x-axis (the horizontal line with equation \(y = 0\)) can be found by solving \( f(x) = 0 \) for values of \(x\). These values are often known as the solutions to the equation or the roots of the function.</li>
        <li>The y-intercept (y-axis has equation \( x = 0\)) can be solved by finding the value of \(f(x)\) from the quadratic equation when \(x = 0\).</li>
        <li>The minimum point is a stationary point and has a gradient of 0. Stationary points for parabolas have the greatest or least y value so we could find it this way alternatively. A final method would be finding the x-coordinate half-way between the 2 roots of the function and then plugging this value into the equation to find the corresponding y value.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="lead">
        If the above picture of a parabola has a minimum stationary point, what would the shape of a parabola with a maximum point look like? Why would it have a maximum point? Well the shape of the parabola is determined by the whether the leading coefficient (the number term, a in front of \(x^2\)) is positive or negative; positive is a happy-faced parabola, negative a sad one. From the general form of a quadratic we can derive a formula to find us the coordinates for the stationary point of a parabola: (Try and have a go deriving it!)

        $$
        ax^2 + bx + c = a(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2 + (c - \dfrac{b^2}{4a})
        $$
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#proof1">
        Reveal Proof
      </button> <br />
        It is important here to consider that the coordinates of the turning point for equation \( a(x + p)^2 + q\) (substituting p and q in place of the whole completing the square formula) are \( (-p, q) \). Why this is the case will soon be evident once we consider graph transformations of functions.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Now we have found a way to find the stationary point of a parabola, and finding the y-intercept is straight-forward, how do we go about finding the roots of a quadratic equation or more precisely, solving \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) for x. Well, we can factorise (using methods assumed to be taught to you at GCSE) and solve. But sometimes quadratics don't factorise nicely. We can derive a formula to solve quadratics (incidently known as the quadratic formula) by rearranging the general quadratic equation in terms of x to arrive at:

        $$
        x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
        $$
      </p>

        Reveal Proof
      </button>
      <p class="lead">
        How many solutions does a quadratic equation have? Well from the quadratic formula if we treat \( \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \) as "something" or z we end up with either 2 none or 1 depending on the value of \( b^2 - 4ac \); this is known as the discriminant and the following rules tell us how many real solutions a quadratic equation has (or how many times the curve passes the x-axis):
        <ul>
          <li>When \( b^2 - 4ac > 0\) it has 2 real solutions</li>
          <li>When \( b^2 - 4ac = 0\) it has 1 repeated real solution</li>
          <li>When \( b^2 - 4ac < 0\) it has no real solutions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <div id="4"></div>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Simultaneous equations and inequalities</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        So far we have dealt with one equation at a time? But what if there are several equations which describe the same variables? These are known as systems of equations or simultaneous equations. There are 3 ways to solve simultaneous equations with 2 unknown variables (both linear) which you should know from GCSE:
        <ol>
          <li>By Elimination (multiplying the equations so that you can subtract one equation from another to leave you with only one variable to solve for)</li>
          <li>By Substituting one variable in terms of the other into the other equation to end up with one variable to solve for. Then solve for the other variable by another substitution.</li>
          <li>Graphically by finding the point(s) of intersection of the graphs of each expression.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p class="lead">
        Now in A level we must solve simultaneous equations involving a quadratic and a linear expression. The best way to solve these is either substituting the linear into the quadratic or graphically finding the points of intersection. But first we must learn to express solutions to inequalities using set notation:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>\(x < a\) or \(x > b\) is equivalent to \(\{x | x < a\} \cup \{x | x > b\} \)</li>
          <li>\(x > c\) and \(x < d\) is equivalent to \(\{x | c < x\} \cup \{x | x < d\} \)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        Inequalities are when terms in an expression are known to be unequal. Linear inequalities may be solved as if dealing with a standard algebra equation bar one exception: When dividing or multiplying by a negative number you must reverse the inequality operator. Quadratic inequalities are not so straight-forward, instead we must graph the inequality and find the region on the graph which satisfies the inequality. How do we do this?
        <ol>
          <li>Consider whether the inequality includes the curve itself (use a solid line) or not (use a dotted line)</li>
          <li>Sketch the inequality</li>
          <li>See if the region lies above, \( > f(x)\), or below, \( < f(x)\), the curve.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2 class="mt-5">Factorising higher-order polynomials</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        How may we factorise and solve polynomials of higher-order (higher leading coefficient) such as cubics,\( ax^3 \), and quartics? Well formulas exist for these but are pages long and there is no quintic \( ax^5 \) formula. Instead our best bet is using 2 methods: the easy way or the hard way. Let us start with the easy way; the factor theorem. This theorem is a more general case of the remainder theorem which states that given a polynomial function, \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\), if we were to input a value, \( f(d) \) the outputted value is the remainder of \(\dfrac{ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d}{x - r}\). This is the remainder theorem; when the remainder is 0 it is known as the factor theorem. This is the easy way but has the drawback of requiring guessing; which is no problem for a calculator but may be cumbersome in a non-calculator paper so the harder way is sometimes useful, and sometimes the question will explicitly state which method to use. Algebraic division is essentially long division with letters as opposed to numbers. Due to typographic issues we cannot currently display examples in this format so we recommend reading an article by <a href="http://mathematics.laerd.com/maths/algebraic-division-intro.php">Laerd mathematics</a> on the subject.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Graph Transformations and Graphs of Functions</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Recall quadratics all have a parabola shape. Well, actually there exists only one true parabola: \( y = x^2 \) all of the others are translations or transformations of this parabola. Transformation rules "after" the original function alter the outputted value and work as you would, in a way, expect them to, if \( (a, b) \) are points on the function \( g(x) \) then the following transformations exist:
        <ul>
          <li>\( g(x) + d\) shifts up by d: \( (a, b + d) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(x) - d\) shifts down by d: \( (a, b - d) \)</li>
          <li>\( cg(x)\) stretches vertically by c: \( (a, cb) \)</li>
          <li>\( \frac{1}{c} g(x)\) shrinks vertically by c: \( (a, \frac{1}{c}b) \)</li>
          <li>\( - g(x)\) flip (reflection) over the x-axis: \( (a, -b) \)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">Transformation rules "before" the original function are more confusing:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>\( g(x + d) \) shifts left by d: \( (a - d, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(x + d) \) shifts right by d: \( (a + d, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(fx) \) shrinks horizontally by \( \frac{1}{f} \): \( (\frac{1}{f}a, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(-x) \) is a reflection over the y-axis: \( (-a, b) \)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        In order to sketch a polynomial: Factorise it and then plot the points on the x-axis. Do a dot-to-dot which varies depending on whether the factors exponent is even or odd: If its even it meets the x-axis but doesnt cross (and looks like a mini-parabola), If its odd it crosses the x-axis at that point. In order to finish the sketch, determine what happens to the curve at either end of the roots (whether they go to \(-\infty\) or positive). This can be worked out for polynomials by considering the leading coefficient and its' exponent:
        <ol>
          <li> Is the exponent odd or even? If its odd then one end will go the opposite to the other; if its even both ends will go up/down in the same direction.</li>
          <li>Is the coefficient negative or positive? If its positive then the direction will either be like the ends of \( y = x^2 \) or \( y = x^3 \) depending on if its' highest exponent is odd or even. If its negative it will be a reflection of these e.g. \( y = -x^2 \) or \(y = -x^3 \)</li>
        </ol>

                <li>First let us find a perfect square \( (x + z)^2 \) which gives us : \(x^2 + bx \). This can be done by manipulating the perfect square identity:</li>
                $$
                (A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2 \\
                (x + b)^2 = x^2 + 2bx + b^2 \\
                (x + \dfrac{1}{2}b)^2 = x^2 + bx + \dfrac{1}{4}b^2 = x^2 + bx + (\dfrac{b}{2})^2.
                $$
                <li>
                  This now means that we have found a completed square formula for the above term:
                </li>
                $$
                x^2 + bx = (x + \dfrac{b}{2})^2 - (\dfrac{b}{2})^2

                <li>
                  Now let us rewrite this equation into the same form using the identity above: \[ x^2 + bx + c = (x + \dfrac{b}{2})^2 - (\dfrac{b}{2})^2 + c\].
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally, lets rearrange the quadratic equation into a form where we can use the above identity we found.

                  Now we can apply the identity from above to arrive at the completing the square formula:
                </li>
                $$
                a (x + \dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{b}{a})^2 - (\dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{b}{a})^2 + c \\
                ax^2 + bx + c = a(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2 + (c - \dfrac{b^2}{4a})
                $$
              </ol>

                  Start by completing the square (see the above proof for deriving the completed square formula):
                </li>
                $$
                ax^2 + bx + c = a(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2 + c - \dfrac{b^2}{4a}
                $$
                <li>
                  Now all we have to do is use rules of algebra to rearrange the expression to be in terms of x:
                </li>
                $$
                \dfrac{b^2}{4a} - c = a(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2 \\
                \dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a} \times \dfrac{1}{a} = \dfrac{a(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2}{a} \\[1em]
                \sqrt{\dfrac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}} = \sqrt{(x + \dfrac{b}{2a})^2} \\[1em]
                x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
                $$
              </ol>
              Why is there \( \pm \) before the square root? Well every square root can be either the positive square root or negative square root. For example: \( \sqrt{9} = \pm 3\).
