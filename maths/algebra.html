      <h2 class="mt-5"">Power laws</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The purpose of the Algebra module is to teach you new methods to manipulate and solve problems involving letters. Later, we use these methods to explore the relationship between an input and output variable on a graph, as a function.
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        Let us first consider what a "power", exponent or index (whatever term you may prefer) actually means: 
        $$
        a^n = a_1 \times a_2 ... \times a_n   
        $$
        As we see above "a to the power n" means "a times a, n times." There are various rules that allow us to simplify these terms if the base, a, is the same:
        <ol>
          <li>\(a^n \times a^m = a^{n + m}\)</li>
          <li>\(a^n \div a^m = a^{n - m}\)</li>
          <li>\( (a^n)^m = a^{n \times m}\)</li>
        </ol>
        Given we have defined the power rules for positive integer powers, how may we extend these to other number sets? What would \( a^0 \) be? Well intuitively you may think that it must be 0 as it would mean "a times a, 0 times". However, in mathematics, it is very important for rules to be consistent so we must define \( a^0 \) as 1 so that:

        $$
        \dfrac{a^1}{a^1} = a^{1 - 1} = a^0 = 1
        $$

        Now, how would we extend our understanding of power rules to negative numbers? Let us examine an example; if \( a \neq 0 \) and \( m < n\):
        $$
        \dfrac{a^{n-m}}{a^n} = a^{(n-m)-n} = \dfrac{a_1 \times a_2 \times ... a_{n-m} }{a_1 \times a_2 \times ... a_m } = \dfrac{1}{a^m}
        $$
        We can cancel each term on the top and bottom by a the maximum number of times possible and since there are fewer a terms on the top we would be left with 1 and the remaining \( a^m \) on the bottom. Therefore for negative powers we have the rule:

        $$
        a^{-m} = \dfrac{1}{a^m}
        $$

        Now we are ready to extend these rules to include all rational numbers (ie fractions). But first we must remind ourselves of what roots mean. A square root of a number, a, is the number which when multiplied by itself once gives the number a exactly; the nth root of a number, a, would be a number which when multiplied by itself n times gives the number a exactly. Some square roots are integers but a lot are irrational and are left in their root or surd form \( \sqrt{a} \). Using power rule 1. :
        $$
        a^n \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} ... \times a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = a^{\tfrac{n}{n}} = a
        $$
        If we substitute \(a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = b\) we arrive at \( b^n = a \) so then we must define \(a^{\tfrac{1}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a} \). Finally, we end this section by generalising this for cases where the numerator is not 1 but instead \(m\):
        $$
        a^{\tfrac{m}{n}} = (a^{\tfrac{1}{n}})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m}
        $$

      <h2 class="mt-5" id="2">How do Mathematicians find rules?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The job of a pure mathematician lies in discovery; discovering new rules of patterns that lie in wait for the most intelligent of beings to seize them as a result of the basic assumptions/definitions, more formally known as axioms, that define the game of mathematics. Let our journey begin by addressing some basic definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There exists a set (collection of individual objects) of positive integer numbers known as Rational Numbers: \( \N = \{ 1,2,3,4,... \} \) </li>
        <li>There exists a set of integer numbers including all natural numbers, \( \N \), 0 and negative integers:  \( \Z = \{ ...,-1,0,1,...  \} \)</li>
        <li> Letters can be used as variables; to represent different types of numbers or a specific number (Basic algebra)</li>
        <li>There is a set of numbers known as Rational numbers which can be expressed exactly as a ratio (fraction) of two integers: $$  \text{Q} = \{\frac{p}{q} \text{where p and q are integers and } q \neq 0 \} $$</li>
        <li>There exist the following basic operations (and their inverse operations): Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division</li>
        <li>An even number is defined as a multiple of 2 \( 2n \) and An odd number is defined as not an even number: \( 2n - 1, 2n + 1\)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Methods of Proof</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Now we can go about proving, or disproving, new rules given the above assumptions. The methods we will learn and need to apply to basic problems are firstly <b>proof by deduction</b>. This is when we use pre established rules to find the new rule we want to find. As an example, we can prove that an even number added to a different even number is even. let \(2n\) represent an even number and \(2m \) represent another even number:

        $$
        2n + 2m = 2(n + m)
        $$
        Since we can factor out 2 this shows that number \( n + m \) is even. Another method of proof, or more accurately disproof, is by <b>counter-example</b>: Find one example that contradicts the new rule. For example we can disprove that for 2 integers, \( a,b \), if \(a^2 = b^2 \) then \(a = b\):

        If \(a = 3, b = 3 \) then the statement holds. However if \(a = 3, b = -3 \):
        $$
        3^2 = (-3)^2, 3 \neq -3
        $$
        Then the statement does not hold, therefore we have proved the statement to be false. QED. Another method of disproof is by assuming the statement to be true and then finding a contradiction in previously accepted rules of mathematics as a result of the assumption, which proves that the assumption made must be false. A famous <b> proof by contradiction </b> is the proof that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational:

        <ol>
          <li>Assume that  \( \sqrt{2} \) is a rational number and therefore can be expressed as \( \frac{a}{b}, b \neq 0 \) where \( a, b\) are integers in their simplest terms (they do not both have a common divisor). </li>
          <li>
            \((\sqrt{2})^2 =(\dfrac{a}{b})^2\ \\ 2 = \dfrac{a^2}{b^2} \\ 2a^2 = b^2\)
          </li>
          <li>
            We have found that \( b \) must be even as \( b^2 \) is even and the square of an even number is an even number. 
          </li>
          <li>
            We can apply the same argument to \( a \) which must also be even as a result. We can rewrite b and a as \(2m, 2n \) (multiples of 2).
          </li>
          <li>
            Therefore \( \sqrt{2} = \dfrac{2m}{2n}\) which contradicts the fact that \(a, b\) are in their simplest terms. Therefore by contradiction, the \( \sqrt{2} \) must be irrational. QED.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The final method of proof we must know is <b>proof by exhaustion</b>. This is when we work out every possible option to be true so therefore the statement must be true. For example we could prove by exhaustion all of the prime numbers (only exactly divisble by 1 and itself) between 1 and 100. Proof by exhaustion is also helpful in proving more complex problems by splitting them up into smaller proofs. Such as proving the statement true for all even numbers then for all odd numbers and therefore all numbers. Finally, whilst all the proofs above have been with numbers, we can also apply the same methods of proof to geometry (shapes and graphs) yet through working with a different set of established rules.

      <p>
        Here are some simple proof problems with solutions. Whilst reading through this textbook, each rule taught has a proof, and we recommend you to try and prove each rule to help practice this skill. The questions presented are remedial since assuming you have just started the A level course and have not been taught any of the mathematical techniques to prove harder problems.

              	<li>
              		An even integer n is a multiple of 2 so can be written as \(2k\). Let m represent any integer. <br />
              		\(nm = 2km = 2(km)\).
              	</li>
              	<br />
              	<li>
              		Let \( 2j + 1 \) represent an odd number, n, and let \(2k + 1\) represent another distinct odd number, m. <br />
              		\(nm = (2j + 1)(2k + 1) = 4jk + 2j + 2k + 1 = 2(2jk + j + k) + 1\). By substitution of \( 2jk + j + k = z\)  <br />
              		\(nm = 2z + 1\) which proves the statement.
              	</li>
              	<br />
              	<li>
              		\( n^2 - n = n \times n - n = n(n - 1) \). Firstly let us prove the statement for odd numbers then even numbers. If n is odd then let \(  n = 2k + 1\): <br />
              		\(2k+1(2k + 1 - 1) = 2k+1(2k)\). Since anything multiplied by an even number is an even number we can stop here. If n is even then let \(n = 2m \): <br />
              		\(2m(2m - 1).\) The same logic applied above can be used here. QED.
              	</li>
              	<br />
              	<li>
              		We can disprove this given that 2 and 3 are both consecutive prime numbers and sum to an odd number; 5.
              	</li>
              	<br />
              	<li>
              		Again, we can also disprove this statement given that \( a > 0\) and if we let a be 1 it is less than 2.
