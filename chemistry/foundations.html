      <h2 class="mt-5"">What is Chemistry?</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Chemistry is the study of substance, or more precisely the structure and organisation of matter; from the smallest fundamental units in existence which interact with one another to form complex, intricate 3D structures (such as DNA) which enable the variety and beauty of the reality we see around us in the macroscopic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        No prior knowledge is needed in Chemistry aside from mathematical skills (most of which acquired at GCSE level). The foundation topic starts by exploring the various models which define the structure of different substances and their effects on macroscopic properties and interactions with other chemical structures.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Atomic structure</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The atom is the fundamental unit of matter; the smallest singular unit which can exist indefinitely in natural conditions, and from which all other structures studied in Chemistry are derived. Whilst we cannot directly 'see' the inside of an atom, that is not to say we cannot mathematically model their behaviour, and through use of the scientific method, reveal what they probably 'look like'. A simple, and yet effective, perception of an atom is with a central nucleus; containing positively-charged particles (single point) known as protons and neutrons with no charge. This is the densest region of the atom; the rest being predominately empty space with negatively-charged particles wizzing around in fixed shells (circles) akin to planets orbiting round a star. What is charge you may wonder? Well, it is simply a force of which objects either have a negative property or positive property:
        <div class="text-center"><b><h5>charges of the same type attract; charges of the opposite type repel.</h5></b></div>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        This principle is imperative in understanding the essence of chemical structure. But, given this model of the atom, how can protons, with the same charge remain in the nucleus? Surely if we take the above principle as true, the protons would repel and fly off; ripping the atom and destroying the Universe before it ever got going? The neutrons and protons exert a force known as the Strong Nuclear Force to act like glue to prevent repulsion, but, as a consequence a slight portion of mass is actually lost; known as the mass defect. Particles are, relative to our perception and crude equipment for sensing, terribly tiny and .
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Mass on the atomic scale</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        To work out the mass of an atom it may seem sensible for the following calculation to provide a satisfactory solution: 
        $$
        A_r = P + N + E
        $$
        However due to the mass defect in the nucleus this is impractical and implausible. Instead, like with the individual particles themselves we must consider a relative scale; the atomic unit. We define 12 atomic mass units ,\( u \), equivalent to the mass of a carbon-12 isotope. We can accurately measure the relative isotopic mass via the principle of charge attraction-repulsion. We place a sample into a mass spectrometer which is vaporised and ionised; allowing the presence of mobile carriers of charge. The ions, being positively charged experience an attractive force, causing acceleration to a negatively-charged plate. The time taken is proportional to their mass, and for +1 ions their mass to charge ratio is equal to the relative isotopic mass. The frequency at which the ions hit the negative plate is detected and gives a fractional proportion of their presence in the total sample. The mass spectrum graph then analyses the data collected and produces a mass spectrum graph. From these relative isotopic masses we can calculate the relative atomic mass via the calculation:

        $$
        \sum^{i}_{i = 1} f_i I_i = f_1 \times I_1 + f_2 \times I_2 ... + f_i \times I_i
        $$
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Mass on the molecular scale</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Like with relative masses, we must use another scale of measure for the number of individual constituent objects (particles) within a structure; this may be ions or atoms, within a substance. This unit is known as the mole and 1 mole is the number of particles within 12 grams of carbon-12, also known as Avogadro's Number, \(N_A = 6.02 \times 10^{23} \). This clever use of units allows us to easily switch been the relative mass scale and the standard unit scale. Depending on the state of matter of the substance, we use different formulas for conversion:
        <ul>
          <li>Solid:n mass in moles, m mass in grams, M molar mass, \( \text{g mol}^{-1}\) (= Relative Molecular Mass) \( n = \dfrac{m}{M}\)</li>
          <li>Liquid: c concentration (\(\text{mol dm}^{-3}\)), V volume in decimetres cubed \( n = cV \)</li>
          <li>Gas: Vm molar gas volume (24 dm^3 at RTP) \(n = \dfrac{V}{V_m} \therefore n_{\text{rtp}} = \dfrac{V}{24} \)
        </ul>
      <p class="lead">
        When finding the amount of a substance from an equation, we are able to use a 'molar ratio' by treating each chemical as an exact multiple of one mole. However, for gases where the temperature and pressure is not room temperature, is there a simple equation which will approximate the amount of gas present in moles? We can derive from the gas laws the 'ideal gas equation' which satisfies this purpose:
        $$
        pV = nRT
        $$
        <ol>
          <li>p is pressure in pascals</li>
          <li>V is volume in metres cubed</li>
          <li>n is the amount of gas present in moles </li>
          <li>R is the ideal gas constant</li>
          <li>T is temperature in Kelvin</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Finally, we must understand the conversation between different units of measure:
      </p>
      <table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Measure</th>
      <th scope="col">Common Unit</th>
      <th scope="col">Unit #2</th>
      <th scope="col">Unit #3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">mass/volume</th>
      <td>\( \text{dm}^{3}\)</td>
      <td> \(1\text{gram} \approx \text{ 1cm}^{3}  = \text{1ml}^{3}\ \ (\times 10^{-3}) \) </td>
      <td>\( \text{m}^3 \ (\times 10^{3}) \)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
