      <p class="lead">
        How can we mathematically model the motion of light? Well one way is to image the light having the same behaviour as a ripple on a pond. The wave-front is the circular disturbance of the water. The curvature of the circumference of a circle with radius, r, is \( \dfrac{1}{r}\)

      <p class="lead">
        So far we have dealt with one equation at a time? But what if there are several equations which describe the same variables? These are known as systems of equations or simultaneous equations. There are 3 ways to solve simultaneous equations with 2 unknown variables (both linear) which you should know from GCSE:
        <ol>
          <li>By Elimination (multiplying the equations so that you can subtract one equation from another to leave you with only one variable to solve for)</li>
          <li>By Substituting one variable in terms of the other into the other equation to end up with one variable to solve for. Then solve for the other variable by another substitution.</li>
          <li>Graphically by finding the point(s) of intersection of the graphs of each expression.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p class="lead">
        Now in A level we must solve simultaneous equations involving a quadratic and a linear expression. The best way to solve these is either substituting the linear into the quadratic or graphically finding the points of intersection. But first we must learn to express solutions to inequalities using set notation:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>\(x < a\) or \(x > b\) is equivalent to \(\{x | x < a\} \cup \{x | x > b\} \)</li>
          <li>\(x > c\) and \(x < d\) is equivalent to \(\{x | c < x\} \cup \{x | x < d\} \)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="lead">
        Inequalities are when terms in an expression are known to be unequal. Linear inequalities may be solved as if dealing with a standard algebra equation bar one exception: When dividing or multiplying by a negative number you must reverse the inequality operator. Quadratic inequalities are not so straight-forward, instead we must graph the inequality and find the region on the graph which satisfies the inequality. How do we do this?
        <ol>
          <li>Consider whether the inequality includes the curve itself (use a solid line) or not (use a dotted line)</li>
          <li>Sketch the inequality</li>
          <li>See if the region lies above, \( > f(x)\), or below, \( < f(x)\), the curve.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2 class="mt-5">(2) Signalling</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        How may we factorise and solve polynomials of higher-order (higher leading coefficient) such as cubics,\( ax^3 \), and quartics? Well formulas exist for these but are pages long and there is no quintic \( ax^5 \) formula. Instead our best bet is using 2 methods: the easy way or the hard way. Let us start with the easy way; the factor theorem. This theorem is a more general case of the remainder theorem which states that given a polynomial function, \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\), if we were to input a value, \( f(d) \) the outputted value is the remainder of \(\dfrac{ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d}{x - r}\). This is the remainder theorem; when the remainder is 0 it is known as the factor theorem. This is the easy way but has the drawback of requiring guessing; which is no problem for a calculator but may be cumbersome in a non-calculator paper so the harder way is sometimes useful, and sometimes the question will explicitly state which method to use. Algebraic division is essentially long division with letters as opposed to numbers. Due to typographic issues we cannot currently display examples in this format so we recommend reading an article by <a href="http://mathematics.laerd.com/maths/algebraic-division-intro.php">Laerd mathematics</a> on the subject.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mt-5">Graph Transformations and Graphs of Functions</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Recall quadratics all have a parabola shape. Well, actually there exists only one true parabola: \( y = x^2 \) all of the others are translations or transformations of this parabola. Transformation rules "after" the original function alter the outputted value and work as you would, in a way, expect them to, if \( (a, b) \) are points on the function \( g(x) \) then the following transformations exist:
        <ul>
          <li>\( g(x) + d\) shifts up by d: \( (a, b + d) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(x) - d\) shifts down by d: \( (a, b - d) \)</li>
          <li>\( cg(x)\) stretches vertically by c: \( (a, cb) \)</li>
          <li>\( \frac{1}{c} g(x)\) shrinks vertically by c: \( (a, \frac{1}{c}b) \)</li>
          <li>\( - g(x)\) flip (reflection) over the x-axis: \( (a, -b) \)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">Transformation rules "before" the original function are more confusing:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>\( g(x + d) \) shifts left by d: \( (a - d, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(x + d) \) shifts right by d: \( (a + d, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(fx) \) shrinks horizontally by \( \frac{1}{f} \): \( (\frac{1}{f}a, b) \)</li>
          <li>\( g(-x) \) is a reflection over the y-axis: \( (-a, b) \)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        In order to sketch a polynomial: Factorise it and then plot the points on the x-axis. Do a dot-to-dot which varies depending on whether the factors exponent is even or odd: If its even it meets the x-axis but doesnt cross (and looks like a mini-parabola), If its odd it crosses the x-axis at that point. In order to finish the sketch, determine what happens to the curve at either end of the roots (whether they go to \(-\infty\) or positive). This can be worked out for polynomials by considering the leading coefficient and its' exponent:
        <ol>
          <li> Is the exponent odd or even? If its odd then one end will go the opposite to the other; if its even both ends will go up/down in the same direction.</li>
          <li>Is the coefficient negative or positive? If its positive then the direction will either be like the ends of \( y = x^2 \) or \( y = x^3 \) depending on if its' highest exponent is odd or even. If its negative it will be a reflection of these e.g. \( y = -x^2 \) or \(y = -x^3 \)</li>
        </ol>
